My Summer Activities

I didn't do to much over my summer break, but there were some activities that were fun. 
I had to take two summer courses over the summer, that took a while to finish, but after 
I got done with those courses, I got to take a trip out of the state  to Armenia! It was  
really fun to be their with my family, and we had an amazing time. I had the last two weeks 
of summer break to just relax and chill.

Goals for this School Year

I have a lot of goals for this school year, especially how I have to take four AP classes, 
in my sophmore year! My main goals are to maintain a GPA above 4.2, and manage to get 3s or
more on the AP tests in May. I also hope to get A's on my midterm, and final tests for the semesters.

Sports and Physical Activities

I am the type of person who likes to stay active all the time! Especially summer break since we have 
a whole month to just relax and chill. Over the summer, before I went on my trip to Armenia, I had a tournament
for my AAU basketball team. We managed to beat a lot of teams, but lost in the end. It was a really fun experience.
After I came back from my trip, I went to the gym every weekend with my dad. I also went to the park a few times a week
with my family to play all types of sports like basketball, football, and even frisbe. We got a big workout in over the 
summer and I got to say in shape.

My Favorite Summer Memory with Friends

Me and my friends wanted to hang out so much over the break, we saw each other almost 2 times a week! We would usually
play video games together in general, but then I broke my monitor and please dont ask why haha. After that, me or my friends
would host a day to just play games, swim, eat, and play basketball. We even got to go see the new Deadpool and Wolverine movie
together. They would usually come to my house because most of my friedns were renevating their house, but my house is perfect. 
I already miss playing and hanging out with them, and there isn't a lot of breaks during the school year so its gonna be devestating.
